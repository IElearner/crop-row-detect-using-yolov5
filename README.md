# crop-row-detect-using-yolov5

Hi,this is my capstone project @sjtu

the algorithm is composed by 2 parts, 
the first part we use the yolov5 to do the segment task,the original code:https://github.com/z1069614715/yolov5-seg
and the second part is wrote in the image_process_formal.py,and utilized the work from:https://github.com/EarlJr53/row-crop-detection

step1:

the label was done by using labelme
sorry we can not afford you the completed dataset,but there is one best.py that we have trained ,you can use that in the predict.py pr predict_test.py
you can contact flyljd02@outlook.com for more detatils
